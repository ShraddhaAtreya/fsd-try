## Project Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**
   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the project repository:

   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   If there are any dependencies specified in a `package.json` file, install them using npm:
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   You can start the application using a local server. If you have a server setup (like `live-server` or `http-server`), run:
