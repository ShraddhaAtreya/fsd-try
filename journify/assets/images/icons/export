The directory for export-related icons is typically used to store image files such as SVGs or PNGs that represent export actions. Since you requested the contents of the `/journify/journify/assets/images/icons/export` directory, it is common to include some example icon files. However, as this is a directory, it does not contain any specific files by default. 

Here is the response for the contents of that directory:

# /journify/journify/assets/images/icons/export
This directory is intentionally left blank.
