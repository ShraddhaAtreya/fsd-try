The directory for mood-related emoji/icons is intended to contain image files representing different moods. Below are some example image files that could be included in the `/journify/journify/assets/images/icons/mood` directory:

- happy.png
- sad.png
- angry.png
- anxious.png
- calm.png
- excited.png
- neutral.png

You can create these image files using any graphic design tool or download them from a free icon resource. The actual images should be placed in the specified directory. 

Hereâ€™s how the contents of the `/journify/journify/assets/images/icons/mood` directory would look:

happy.png
sad.png
angry.png
anxious.png
calm.png
excited.png
neutral.png

Make sure to name the files according to the mood they represent for easy identification and use in your application.
